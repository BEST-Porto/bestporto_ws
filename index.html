            <p>
                BEST Porto, a Local BEST Group, is present in the Faculties of Science (FCUP) and Engineering (FEUP) of the University of Porto, being headquartered in the latter. It was founded in 1996 and has been growing ever since, becoming a dynamic academic group with enormous potential for student development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, BEST Porto has about 60 members and organizes several events every year. Our Local Group shares the same vision as BEST Internacional, Enpowered Diversity, and believes in personal and professional growth, through contact with that diversity.

                Engineering Competitions are events where teams of students use their technical, social and communication skills to fulfill a specific task or case. On these competitions and under specific conditions (time, situation, materials, etc), teams of students compete to provide the most optimised solution in terms of performance, cost and innovation. These criteria differ depending on the competition category, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>TEAM DESIGN</li>
                <li>DEBATES</li>
                <li>CASE STUDY</li>
                <li>NEGOTIATION</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The key factors at play to successfully face these challenge are creativity, adaptation and imagination! Challenge your engineering skills through:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Local Engineering Competitions;</li>

            <h1>Educational Involvement</h1>
            <h2>
                Developing students is our mission, so what better way is there to achieve this than to try to improve education?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Through the Educational Involvement Department, BEST strives to listen to the students' ideas on what can be changed in their universities, study programmes or curricula. BEST is eager to be in close collaboration with the stakeholders of higher education, letting them know about innovative solutions, coming from the main receivers of education-students.
            </p>
            <p>
                To gather the students' opinions, BEST organises BEST Symposia on Education (BSEs), conducts surveys, and interacts with local students by means of the LBGs. The outcomes of the discussions are gathered afterwards and later presented at international conferences on education, in the form of scientific papers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In parallel, Local BEST Groups organise Local Events on Education (LEoEs) where students have the opportunity to discuss topics concerning their own university, educational system or other local topics.
            </p>

            <p>
                We strive to stay up-to-date in this field, attending several international conferences per year, getting to know the state-of-the-art topics, and taking the opportunity to network with relevant higher educational institutions and individuals.
